# Code Quiz

## Welcome to the Wonderful World of Web APIs

This quiz is a project to develop my skills in creating Web APIs. The quiz uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic quiz that the user can enjoy. Because the JavaScript code is communicating with the web browser in this project, it is an example of a Web API. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up

This is a mockup demonstrating the application.
